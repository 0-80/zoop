# zoop
zoop is a tool for quick reusable text script things.

you can write a script that takes 1 variable `text` and returns the output

and then provide some input, and it will run your function on the input.

you can automatically load a script from url with `surl` url param

see the file itself and examples (below) for how it actually works

## examples
removed because i changed my username

## todo
add a version that doesn't automatically run
